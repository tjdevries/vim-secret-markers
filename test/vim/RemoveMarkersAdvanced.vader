Given python (A comment before the markers on the same line):

Execute (Remove the folds):

  # Yup, inside the fold

Execute (Remove the folds):
  " TODO: Maybe there shouldn't be that whitespace after `x = a` and the following line
  "   I can try and fix that, but we'll have to see what happens there. I don't want
  "   the white space to be deleted later though and left behind
  VertexRemove

Expect python (All the regular stuff should be there):
