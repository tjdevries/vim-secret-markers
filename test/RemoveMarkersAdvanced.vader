Given python (A comment before the markers on the same line):
  first_line = 'Hello world'
  # This is a comment {{{
  # Now inside the fold
  # }}}
    # Another comment {{{ now with fold definitions on the outside
  # Yup, inside the fold
  # Last line }}}

Execute (Remove the folds):
  call RemoveMarkers()

Expect python (Only the fold and the words after it to be removed):
  first_line = 'Hello world'
  # This is a comment
  # Now inside the fold
    # Another comment
  # Yup, inside the fold
  # Last line
